## About
This is a Linux script that can convert: Video files, Audio Files and YouTube Links.
The output of the conversion is a video Xvid file that is compatible with the Sony DVP-FX780 DVD Player.
This script is made specifically for use with USB drives and it therefore not tested with DVDs.
## YouTube Links
The script accepts both video and audio YouTube links but it is not intended for use with audio links as the music artwork will be stretched (this does not apply to music videos, and only applies to non 16:9 videos).
## Audio Files
The Audio Files convertion option has a submenu with 2 options
### Visualizer
A waveform visualizer That can be set to the following colors: gray, magenta, cyan, yellow, blue, green, red, black.
### Artwork
Shows the artwork embedded in the audio file selected.
## Video Files
This convertion option also accepts mp3 files but trying to play them on the DVD Player will result in an error.
